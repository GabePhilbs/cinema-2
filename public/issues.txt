	How to load stuff from timeline into film display if the use different controllers



	Gameplan:

		Jquery and angular don't work well togheter, so kill all Jquery

			link timeline to /film

			Make forms hide and show using ng-if and ng-show , and an array

			Make carousel with angular(if there is time)

			Build accordion with angular (if there is time) (I CAN REUSE A LOT OF THE FORM VIEW CODE)

			Use service to send info from timeline to film display(will learn this monday)
